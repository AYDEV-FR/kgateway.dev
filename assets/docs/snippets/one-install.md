Keep in mind that you can only have one installation of {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} with the Kubernetes Gateway API at a time. Installing the product twice causes required Kubernetes resources that are cluster-scoped, such as GatewayClass, to fail. You can still create multiple Gateway resources to configure HTTP and HTTPS listeners on {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}}.
