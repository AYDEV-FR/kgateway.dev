Review how the {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} project handles the lifecycle of Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVEs).

The end-to-end lifecycle for CVE handling consists of the stages in the following diagram.

{{< reuse-image src="img/cve-process.svg" caption="Figure: Lifecycle stages for CVE handling" >}}

|Stage|Description|
|--|--|
|[Inbound](#inbound)|Inbound channels for reporting potential CVEs that affect {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} products, including FedRAMP requirements for monthly vendor responses to security scans. |
|[Tracking](#tracking)|Continuous monitoring of reported CVEs with details on assessment and remediation status.|
|[Analysis](#analysis)|Determination of whether a given CVE affects {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} products, the CVE severity, and suggested remediation plan if required.|
|[Remediation](#remediation)|A change introduced to a product (code fix, dependency bump, etc.) that is incorporated into a product release.|
|[Reporting](#reporting)|Communication of CVE-related information to parties outside of {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}}, including customers.|


## CVE lifecycle stages

Learn more about each CVE lifecycle stage.

### Inbound 

The following sources are used to determine product exposure to CVEs:
* {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} performs continuous CVE scanning of supported product components to detect vulnerabilities.
* {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} customers may share output from their own security scanning tools for analysis and response from {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}}.
* {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} participates in early disclosure and security workgroups of multiple upstream communities.
* {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} maintains a public security site that is open to all users to report potential security issues.
* {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} customers with regulatory requirements for regular scans (e.g. FedRAMP) submit their scan output to {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} for vendor remediation response.

### Tracking
All reported CVEs that meet the minimum threshold enter the tracking process step. The minimal threshold for tracking includes:
* All CVEs reported with a severity of CRITICAL or HIGH.
* Any CVEs with severity of MODERATE or LOW that are determined to have a significant impact on our security posture.

Embargoed CVEs are tracked in a separate repository and subject to the constraints set forth by the associated upstream security workgroup.


### Analysis
Analysis of reported CVEs consists of the following steps:
* Perform an initial review to filter out CVEs that do not apply to our products (e.g. false positives due to invalid scan results).
* Conduct an initial assessment of the severity based on NIST scoring along with alternative scoring from the community. 
* Review each CVE that is eligible for remediation to determine if an attack vector exists in the context of {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}}’s products. If no attack vector exists, then the CVE is downgraded with no further remediation activity.


### Remediation
Remediation of a CVE involves introducing a fix to the affected code and releasing the associated component. The process and timing for these activities can be separated into two categories:
* Direct control: {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} has the ability to contribute fixes and release the associated component. This is generally the case with code in the Gloo Gateway codebase.
* Indirect control: {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} is subject to the contribution and release policies of a third-party community. This is generally the case with upstream dependencies that are included in Gloo Gateway.

Fixes for CVEs that impact dependencies are subject to the ability of the third-party community to accept these fixes and to incorporate them into a release. 


### Reporting

Security scan results for product images are published in the {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} documentation with each release.

In addition to public reporting on security scanning, {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} works directly with customers on FedRAMP reporting and compliance requirements related to CVE scan results. {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} reviews customer scan reports, evaluates CVEs, remediates CVEs based on {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}}’s analysis, and provides vendor responses to identified CVEs.  

Certain CVEs require special attention due to their disclosure status, severity, or heightened awareness (e.g. Heartbleed, Log4j). In these cases, {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} may use additional reporting channels, including direct email and the {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} blog, to communicate CVE information.


## Updates & Questions
{{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}} reserves the right to change this process in its sole discretion. {{< reuse "docs/snippets/product-name.md" >}}’s security processes are reviewed regularly to ensure compliance with industry standards and the current security landscape.
